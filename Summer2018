We began the trip on May 17, 2018.

Day 1 was <a href="Summer/Arizona.html">Arizona</a>.
Then on to New Mexico.
Texas was rainy, but Houston was nice.
The beignets were the best part of New Orleans.
We made a quick stop to see the Gulf of Mexico.
Next was Momtgomery and Tuskegee.
Atlanta = family time and civil rights history.
Virginia was a nice break on a long drive to Washington, DC.
Maryland = family time and civil war history.
