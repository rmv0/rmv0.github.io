<br>Day 1 was <a href="https://rmv0.github.io/Summer/Arizona.html">Arizona</a>.</br>
<br>Then on to New Mexico.</br>
<br>Texas was rainy, but Houston was nice.</br>
<br>The beignets were the best part of New Orleans.</br>
<br>We made a quick stop to see the Gulf of Mexico.</br>
<br>Next was Momtgomery and Tuskegee.</br>
<br>Atlanta = family time and civil rights history.</br>
<br>Virginia was a nice break on a long drive to Washington, DC.</br>
<br>Maryland = family time and civil war history.</br>
